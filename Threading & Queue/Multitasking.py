â–¶ Multitasking : 
Multitasking allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving efficiency,
especially for I/O-bound or CPU-bound operations.

Types of multitasking in Python:
  1. Process-based multitasking using the multiprocessing module.
       Uses separate processes to run tasks concurrently. Suitable for CPU-bound tasks.
  2. Thread-based multitasking using the threading module.
       Uses threads within a single process to run tasks concurrently. Suitable for I/O-bound tasks.
